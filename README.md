# SecondFloorHSERC
Contains Unity3d project and the related codes/XML files to instantiate the environment of the Second Floor space  (walls only as of now, and information was obtained from Alexandr Petcovici's XML description).

There is also a UI interface where if numbers are put in the InputFields for Position and Scale in X, Y, and Z, a cube of specified dimensions and positioning will be isntantiated.

XMLHSERC.xml is another working XML which will accept information for cube dimensions and position, and will instantiate it during runtime. 

**CompileMCL.cs Line 28, CompileMCLAish.cs Line 27 (this code is no longer used anyway) have my directory information (C:Users/Aishwarya...) so if these codes are used, it will error! The user must replace these lines with the proper string directory location for their Unity project Resources folder.**
